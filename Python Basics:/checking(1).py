# INDENTATION matters in Python!

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#You can put both of these STATEMENTS in seperate lines but by typing a semicolon, this also works.
name = "sam"; print(name)

#We can also check DATA TYPES. For example:
print(type(name)) #This prints out the DATA TYPE of the variable                     name

#We can also compare it. For example:
print(type(name) == str) #This evalutes to TRUE and vice versa if                            it isn't a string

#We can also use isinstance. This checks if name is an INSTANCE of a string. For example:
print(isinstance(name, str)) #We pass two things. We pass the                                   variable and the data type
