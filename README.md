# Learn-Python
Want to learn the basic fundamentals of Python? I have provided most of the useful and important mechanics you can do in Python, beginner-friendly!

Hello! I watched a 4-hour Python Beginner Guide and took some notes while using Replit as I followed through the video. So I decided 
why not create a repository to shows the notes that I have taken to help YOU as well. All of my notes were originally in 1 FILE (aMain(0).py)
But afterwards I broke down my notes into their different files so they are more organized and understandable.

So while going through the files, I recommend following their numbers (#), next to the file names since they all kind of connect.

If you have any questions or want to provide me with advice to touch up a few things here, please email me at:
